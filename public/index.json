Refuse to take standardized tests. Standardized tests are a scam forced upon us by the College Board to make more money. By taking them, you are dignifying this evil capitalist system. It\u0026rsquo;s not like they\u0026rsquo;re that important anyway, colleges don\u0026rsquo;t really care that much about your academic performance in the first place.\n2.) Do everything you can to get into a top school. If you don\u0026rsquo;t get into Yale or Cornell, your life will be over, you might as well become a plumber or something. No one in the history of the world has had a happy or fulfilling life without being to Yale or Cornell \u0026ndash; how can life be worth living without snobby rich friends?!\n3.) Choose your admissions essay as the time for a principled stand against social - desirability bias. People write their admissions essay in a complicated language of lies and half truths. This makes you seem slimy and it violates your principles! So, don\u0026rsquo;t do it! Instead of saying \u0026ldquo;I joined the underwater marble stacking club out of my great passion or the subject\u0026rdquo; say \u0026ldquo;I need to convince you I\u0026rsquo;m a well - rounded person. Instead of saying \u0026ldquo;I spent a gap year traveling because I wanted to see the world,\u0026rdquo; say \u0026ldquo;I wanted to have sex with Europeans.\u0026rdquo; You get the picture!\n4.) Mention your East Asian heritage. Everyone knows Asians tend to be hard - workers who excel academically, so colleges are really happy to have them! Right?\n5.) Put your mom down as your only character reference. Parents are the most objective sources of information about their children, and colleges all know this. Besides, your mom is well known among college recruiters and most have positive memories of her.\n6.) Humorously respond to texts from colleges. The random texts you get from colleges are all sent by bots, and an actual human being will never read your response. So, why not have a little fun and write something humorous, like \u0026ldquo;did you really think I want to live in a third world country like Alabama?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Shut the hell up Chloe ion wanna attend yo bum ass school.\u0026rdquo;\n7.)

The Kabal just keeps runnin\u0026rsquo; public schools into the ground, so a load of you people have been thinkin\u0026rsquo; about homeschooling your full Quivers. Sadly, Satan personally runs several Websites which dispense with unhelpful, spiritually Dangerous, and downright Liberal advice about how to homeschool. To combat this Brood of Vipers, I have been Raised Up to set the Record straight. If you follow my Dictates, along with establishing the requisite hedge of Protection around your homestead, Satan will not be able to get your little darlins.\n1.) Whatever you do, don\u0026rsquo;t send them to a co - op. Co - ops are these glorified public school things, things where you sent your children to be taught by someone else and be part of a class a few times a week. For all you know, this person might be a Satanist, or even a liberal. I have seen co - ops were people rebel against Nature on the daily, places where girls wear pants, dye their hair vile Colors, and have the gall to Drive themselves to school.\n2.) Be Watchful about the textbooks you give your Quiver. Naturally, you will want to avoid any and all of those humanist, public school textbooks. But, many \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;Christian\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; textbooks are scarce better. I have seen biology textbooks which use evolutionary assumptions, anatomy textbooks which mention the efficacy of \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;vaccines,\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; art books which contain pornographics, and history books that refuse to call the War of Northern Aggression by it true, God - given name.\n3.) Let your little darlins learn at their own pace. Deadlines put a damper on the natural, care - free state of your children. It\u0026rsquo;s far better to let them roam out into the cornfields and learn whatever they want at their own pace. This will do wonders for their academic performance.\n4.) Stringently vet your children\u0026rsquo;s playmates. When children reach a certain age, many of them wish to venture out of your homestead and befriend others. Though it may not be ideal, this is not an Evil in and of itself. However, you must make sure they do not Ensnare themselves in the World. I have seen many a children dragged Astray by the vile Machinations of a demon - possessed, Humanist toddler.\n5.) Inject my essential oils into your Quiver\u0026rsquo;s arms. As is common knowledge, the Kabal puts many chemicals into the drinking water designed to turn your children into homophile Satanists. The best way to counteract this Satanic attack is to inject my essential oil\u0026rsquo;s into your little darlins\u0026rsquo; bodies. It will also decalcify their penial gland, guaranteed.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/humor/aaa/6---homeschooling/","title":"Assorted Awful Advice Part Six: Gomer's Guide to Christian Homeschooling"},{"content":"Assorted Awful Advice Part Five: PC Care Jeb Smutty is a 14 year old middle school student in Fort Worth, Texas, where he spends his days watching anime, browsing Reddit, and making life hell for his older sister, Kristie. Despite his young age, Smutty has gained quite a reputation for exacerbating technical difficulties and bemoaning his perpetual celibacy all across the internet. When we decided to host an article about computers, we knew he was just the man for the job. With the Oxford Dictionary of Zoomer Slang in hand, our resident paleographer was able to translate several more obscure phrases into oldspeak for the benefit of readers over 30.\nHey fellas, I\u0026rsquo;m Mister Smutty, but you can call me Smut for short. Everyone does. There are a bunch of people out there who, no cap, don\u0026rsquo;t know how to use computers in 2023, so I\u0026rsquo;m here to help out.\n1.) When your computer gets hot, throw it into the nearest lake. This is called \u0026ldquo;water cooling,\u0026rdquo; and all serious PC users use it.\n2.) Don\u0026rsquo;t buy cooling at all. Sometimes, cooling just gets expensive. Just using the cooler that comes with your CPU might make you a cheap wuss, so I had to buy my own high - falutin\u0026rsquo; one. That got me a hundred dollars in debt to my mean older sister, and my parents, like, expect me to pay her back or something. Don\u0026rsquo;t be like me, just don\u0026rsquo;t use no cooling at all. You\u0026rsquo;ll be fine. Probably. Don\u0026rsquo;t @me.\n3.) Install PC Optimizer Pro. PC Optimizer Pro is, like, the most based app ever. It detects all of these viruses no other programs are able to and then lets you get rid of them for a fair price.\n4.) Give websites access to any and all permissions they request. Hell yeah that piracy website needs to know your location! Why would they ask for it if they didn\u0026rsquo;t need it?\n5.) Add RGB lighting to your PC build. RGB lighting is real drippy, but it\u0026rsquo;s also both quick and easy to add to your build. More importantly, in a similar way to how putting stickers on race cars makes them go vroom faster, RGB lighting can improve the processing speed of a PC by several orders of magnitude.\n6.) Plug your monitor into your CPU rather than your graphics card. This will keep your GPU from overheating. I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing this for months and it works fine, I can even get 10 FPS in Skyrim!\n7.) Use TempleOS. Windows, Linux, and Mac may be good at all, but they aren\u0026rsquo;t based and redpilled. Their creation wasn\u0026rsquo;t literally mandated by God. TempleOS\u0026rsquo;s was. \u0026lsquo;Nuff said.\n8.) Scrape the pins off the bottom of your CPU. The pins on the bottom of your CPU tickle your motherboard and make it sneeze, which is why my PC started emitting smoke yesterday. Best nip that problem in the bud and get rid of those damn pins.\n9.) Download more RAM. On God, if your computer is slow, you better do this. One cannot simply download too much RAM. Kristie thinks this is stupid, but that\u0026rsquo;s because she\u0026rsquo;s a MORON!\n10.) Bash your PC over and over with a large metal clock. This is called \u0026ldquo;overclocking,\u0026rdquo; and it does wonders for performance.\n12.) Download things from shady websites. It\u0026rsquo;s a well - known fact that AI - generated websites which look like they were made in the 90s are the best places to find software. That and the ads you get at the top of Google search results!\n13.) Collect dust specifically to feed into your PC. Everyone has to eat, and computers are no exception. For me, this might mean eating Pizza and drinking Mnt Dew, but for computers it means eating dust. To feed your computer dust, sweep some up into a dustpan, take your computer\u0026rsquo;s panel off, and throw it all in.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/humor/aaa/5---pc-care/","title":"Assorted Awful Advice Part Five: PC Care"},{"content":"Assorted Awful Advice Part Four: How to Become a Millionaire Sleazy McFly is a well - known self help author and convicted con artist.

Either way, science backs this piece of advice up: 98% (!) of non - millionaires have not given 75% of their income to me[1].

If you publicly spend a load of money, it may not make you a millionaire, but it\u0026rsquo;ll at least make other people think you have disposable income.\n5.) Commit tax fraud. This both lets you keep more money and sets you apart from the blue - pilled sheeple.\n6.) Take money out of offering plates at churches. Churches are collecting that money to give to well - off, wannabe millionaires (that\u0026rsquo;s what Jesus was all about, right?). It\u0026rsquo;s no harm to take some out directly.\n7.)

And, in the immortal words of Tommy Johnson, a musician who enjoyed great success after forfeiting his soul at a roadside deal with the Devil, \u0026ldquo;It ain\u0026rsquo;t like I was using it or nothing.\u0026rdquo; [2]\n8.)

Toilet use in dreams has a long and prestigious history, dating back to the times of the ancient Greeks. They believed that if you used a dream toilet, upcoming lottery numbers would be miraculously revealed to you. I can tell you this works from personal experience.\n2.) Never change your sheets. Cleaning your sheets is just so \u0026hellip; unnatural. It drives away natural wonders like lice and body odor! How could anyone want that?\n3.) Ponder the deep questions of life while you try to sleep. How do we know anything at all? Is there a God? Does Becky want to sleep with you or is she just being nice? These questions and others have fascinated and confounded philosophers for centuries, and there\u0026rsquo;s no better time to think about then than while you\u0026rsquo;re a half - sleeping, melatonin drenched mess.\n4.) Cook recipes revealed to you in dreams. The ancestral spirits occasionally reveal recipes to people while deep in sleep. They are always delicious, cheap, and filled with vitamins!\n5.)

Phelps is a burgeoning TikTok star and professional social media influencer. Since his rise to stardom last Tuesday, Phelps has helped at least three men just like you get laid, or so he claims on the ‘about’ section of his YouTube page. He lives in his parents’ basement in Boston, where he enjoys drinking Mountain Dew and browsing 4chan with the love of his life, a Sailor Moon bodypillow.\nWhether it’s because of soy or feminism or the fluoride in the drinking water, it seems like men these days just struggle to find the girl they deserve. That’s where ya boi Lester comes in. Informed by ten years of personal experience browsing various online message boards, I have created this ten point program to help any man attract the girl of his dreams.\n1.) Refrain from showering and using deodorant. There’s no greater aphrodisiac for women than the pheromones coming off of an unwashed male body. Many people continue to deny this (despite the overwhelming evidence) because the corporate media has been bribed by big shampoo to produce pro-shower propaganda.\n2.) Stand outside of her window at 3:00 AM while yodeling and flapping your arms like a pidgeon. Running around in circles, being naked, and having downed a keg of beer beforehand all help. To put the cherry on the top, occasionally let out a storkish mating call. I have had more success with this method than any other.\n3.) Put up attraction signs all over town. An attraction sign is a small poster which informs women what you’re about. It should have some information about yourself and then list everything important you’re looking for in a woman: maximum tolerable BMI, desired bra size, hair color, etc. Before his transformation into a lesbian goddess, the noted stud Christian Weston Chandler employed this strategy with great success.\n4.) Brag about how big your pockets are to her in order to assert dominance. Women, as is well – known, have pockets whose length and width are measured in planck units. Sometimes they just need a little reminder of this to put them in their place. Somehow, doing this will make them want to have sex with you. We’re still in the dark as to why.\n5.) Send her dick pics. If there’s one thing women love, it’s receiving grainy images of your penis, preferably with captions such as “You want a piece of this!?!?!?” or “HERE”S JOHNNY!1!11” This trait evolved among women during the Pliocene. People were less progressive then, so pornography was illegal. If you were caught distributing it, the tribal elders would throw shit at you. Taking that risk made you rebellious, bold, and zesty. Either that or you just wanted people to throw shit at you, which also makes the girls go wild.\n6.) Become a Discord moderator. Though often unfairly maligned, Discord moderators are incredibly effective with the ladies. This is largely because of our unique body type and well – regarded manners.\n7.) Remember that she’s hypergamous. Students of female nature like Andrew Tate have known this for a long time. It means that chicks are into guys who are super hyper. So, if you wanna attract a girl, you should chug about a gallon of coffee and about that much pure sugar. You should also make sure to get your COVID vaccine, because those give people ADHD. Don’t get the boosters though, because they cause autism. Women don’t like that.\n8.) Send her lots of incoherent text messages for no reason. Women just love spam, preferably spam that don’t make a lick of sense. They are thought to have evolved this trait during the Pliocene, when people accessed the internet via a configuration of stone knives and bear skins known as ‘dial up.’ It was really, god - awfully slow, so if a man was willing to send several books worth of incoherent DMs, it meant that he was really dedicated. Either that or he just didn’t have anything better to do, which women also love in a man.\n9.) Invent a disgusting pet name for her. This behavior is often associated with couples who have been together for some time, and is reported to be especially prevalent among newlyweds. But, you don’t have to save your pet names for marriage! You don’t even have to wait until she knows you name! What could make a woman love you more than being called your fuzzy wuzzy love lobster all day long?\n10.) Use pickup lines. Pickup lines have a long and storied history of success. They were invented by the Wright Brothers, who could often be found asking women “Hey, baby, you wanna join the ten foot high club?” While this was certainly not as refined as the modern pickup line, it is notable for historical reasons. Nowadays, researchers have gotten pickup lines down to an exact science; making the world aware of gems like “Are you a toaster? because I want to take a bath with you.” and “I heard you were into antiques, and I’ve got some junk that hasn’t been touched in ages.” Many others of similar effectiveness can be found on the internet, and they’ll make you a stub overnight.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/humor/aaa/2---getting-a-girlfriend/","title":"Assorted Awful Advice Part Two: How to Get a Girlfriend"},{"content":"Introduction While my Christian Homeschool co - op had many idiosyncrasies, one of the most memorable is how we were forced to read and complete math problems before our classmates. Sometimes these were taken out of textbooks or off of the internet, but more often we invented them ourselves (frequently on the drive over to school or during lunch). Mostly, their narratives were really boring, like the point was supposed to be learning math or something.\nBut my friend Jack and I, being smartasses of a theatrical bent, chose to tell an increasingly surreal story about him breaking the law, doing battle with Jimmy Wales, and going on a quest through Hell to stop Klaus Schwab from summoning the Antichrist.\nWhy we were allowed to continue, especially as I began to satirize my teachers\u0026rsquo; conservative \u0026amp; conspiratorial views about politics \u0026amp; religion, is a great mystery.

Look out at all those SOBs around you - having the audacity to be there all over your road, getting you stuck in traffic, driving around in their ugly - ass smartcars, cutting you off. It just makes me sick. Most of us suppress our disgust at them, but you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t. Mamma ain\u0026rsquo;t listening and you ain\u0026rsquo;t in no church, so give into your anger. Work yourself up into a frenzy of spiritual excitement like a Pentecostal minister speaking in tongues, let obscenities erupt from your mouth like magma from Mount Saint Hellens. Let those bastards know that this is your road.\n2. Remember you always have that right of way. Them \u0026ldquo;teachers\u0026rdquo; of driving in this world want you to believe that you don\u0026rsquo;t always have the right of way. Who the hell do they think they are? You\u0026rsquo;re the ʀᴏᴀᴅᴡᴀʀʀɪᴏʀ for Heaven\u0026rsquo;s sake! This is your road, if one of them trespassers thinks otherwise, let him know thy fury!\n3.) Throw them turtle shells at cars in front of you. This is a trick invented by a noted Italian ʀᴏᴀᴅᴡᴀʀʀɪᴏʀ. Though any turtle shells will work fine, blue ones are ideal.\n4.) Drink them beers while you\u0026rsquo;re driving. I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you a little secret, child. After you\u0026rsquo;s been driving for a while, it just stops being that hard. But, a true ʀᴏᴀᴅᴡᴀʀʀɪᴏʀ never takes the easy path, so you\u0026rsquo;ll need something to add another degree of difficulty. This is where alcohol comes in.\n5.) Give them coppers the bird. I swan, them coppers are the most exasperating sons of bitches on God\u0026rsquo;s flat earth! They\u0026rsquo;ll take some random, unassuming guy, pull him over, and take away his licence for three months because I was going 95 in the suburbs of Mobile! Wait \u0026hellip; Editor, cut that part out!\n6.) Put them controversial bumper stickers on your car. You can\u0026rsquo;t just be driving around like one of them sheeple who don\u0026rsquo;t wanna offend nobody - you\u0026rsquo;re the dad - burn ʀᴏᴀᴅᴡᴀʀʀɪᴏʀ! You\u0026rsquo;ve gotta piss off those other fellas. They\u0026rsquo;re on your road so they deserve it! Best way to do this is to put as many offensive bumper stickers on your car as possible! Put a Confederate flag there, put one up about black power, add a little something - something about gay people \u0026hellip; you get the picture.\n7.) Ignore them check engine lights. Check engine lights were put there by the insurance companies to get you to take your car in more often than it needs. They\u0026rsquo;re just useless!\n8.) Collect them catalytic converters from your fallen enemies. If you\u0026rsquo;re a good ʀᴏᴀᴅᴡᴀʀʀɪᴏʀ, then you\u0026rsquo;ll have rammed into many sissy smartcars. Usually there ain\u0026rsquo;t nothing of value to salvage from them, but every so often you can salvage a catalytic converter and make bank.\n9.) Remember that you are a sovereign citizen. This is a good thing to bring up when them coppers come after you. The government is actually a bankrupt corporation, and you don\u0026rsquo;t owe them nothing.\n10.) Piss into that gas tank of yours. This is a great way to way to avoid having to pay for or siphon gas. Sufficiently alcoholic piss is a real good fuel substitute, and it should be sufficiently alcoholic if you follow step four regularly.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/humor/aaa/1---driving/","title":"Assorted Awful Advice Part One: Driving"},{"content":"Half Empty or Half Full?

Having been defeated, Chase returned to Heck. But this time, as he had been the antichrist, he was numbered among the worst and gravest of sinners; leading to his imprisonment in the deepest and darkest pit of Heck. But, as our heroes learned earlier, it is the most sublime, pleasant, and sexually stimulating of them all. So, all things considered, this was a win for him.\nOur heroes (except for Jack, who was still in a coma) found themselves in a world in which, though not completely marred by the archons, had still been afflicted by them. So, Philip lead the push to renew the world.\nJust as through one man, the antichrist, all were to be made cringe, so through one man, Philip, all were made based. Just as through one man the many would be made soyjacks, so through one man the many were made chads. But each in its own order: Philip, the firstfruits, and then those like Philip on his arrival. Then came the end, when he destroyed every archon and authority and power. (The last enemy to be destroyed was the IRS) Then, when Philip had put all things in subjection under his feet, he subjected himself to Jack, so that Jack might be all in all.\nIn Kingdom of Jack, all influence of the archons has been expunged. As Pastor Jim foretold long ages ago, fast food restaurants other than Chick-fil-a have been abolished - never again will anyone get fries and a drink without being wished a blessed day. Mandatory vaccinations have been replaced with injections of various veterinary medicines, and breatharianism is now accepted nutritional orthodoxy. The gays have been returned to the closet, and the only legal use of the word \u0026ldquo;gay\u0026rdquo; is as a schoolyard insult. Everyone has admitted what they all knew from looking at the trees all along: that there is no God but God and Pastor Jim is his messenger. At Pastor Jim\u0026rsquo;s bidding, Creationism has been returned to public schools. Indeed, all teaching of mainstream science has been outlawed, and science curricula are now solely based on Kent Hovind lectures. Nevermore will anyone see violence in movies nor sex on TV. Yea verily, sex has been abolished. The moon landing has been revealed as the farce it always was, and everyone knows about Agartha. The truth about 9/11 (whatever it is) has finally come out. The birth control, estrogen, micro-plastics, and fluoride that the archons put in the drinking water has been replaced with Nugenix Total-T testosterone booster, which has made all fricking frogs straight.\n\u0026lt;== Back to Math Problems Home Page \u0026lt;==\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/humor/math/epilogue/","title":"Epilogue: The Eschatological Victory of Jack"},{"content":"Math Problem Forty: It\u0026rsquo;s the End of the Line of the Final Journey Jack and his friends run into Jeffery Epstein\u0026rsquo;s house, frantically searching for George Soros and Klaus Schwab - the last two of the archons.\n\u0026ldquo;Wait,\u0026rdquo; says Philip, \u0026ldquo;I hear them on the balcony upstairs, the one overlooking the ocean!

The antichrist is here, and there\u0026rsquo;s nothing we can do to oppose him. He\u0026rsquo;ll conquer the world and destroy liberty. He\u0026rsquo;ll make eating raw meat and taking horse dewormer a thing of the past.\n\u0026ldquo;But still,\u0026rdquo; he says on a more somber note, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m glad that you are here with me, Shaggy, here at the end of all things.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Like \u0026hellip; zoinks?\u0026rdquo; Shaggy responds weakly, collapsing from exhaustion immediately after.\nBut, just as all hope is lost, Jack sees something out of the corner of his eye.\nBehind Chase, there is a veritable armada of Florida men, and at their head stands Pastor Jim, King James Bible in hand, ready to do combat.

Jack wants to join them in fighting the good fight, but he feels himself loosing consciousness, the furries of Chase are simply too much.\nIf there are 22,244,823 people in Florida and roughly half of these are men, how many are Florida men?

The archangel Samael was ordered to create it in order to house truly grave sinners, like rapists and NIMBYs. It was supposed to be based on the sadistic fantasies some religious people had about what would happen to their enemies in the afterlife, all that stuff you find in Dante\u0026rsquo;s Inferno, The Apocalypse of Peter, and some of Tertullian and Arthur Pink\u0026rsquo;s writings on the subject. There were people liquefying in flames, guys being hung from the roof by their testicles, everybody being eaten by worms, something about a girl being painted blue. It was horrible!\n\u0026ldquo;But then a bunch of people realized all that was evil balderdash, so C.S. Lewis invented this idea where Heck is just voluntary separation from God! He published a book about this in 1945, and then 10% of people came to agree with him per decade. When this more humane portrait of eternal \u0026ldquo;punishment\u0026rdquo; came to predominate in the popular imagination, the gates of this circle of Heck became locked from the inside.\n\u0026ldquo;But, that meant old Sammie needed to invent a reason for people not to leave (Saint Peter would be very angry if all these supposedly sequestered sinners just showed up in Heaven demanding to be left in. Nobody wants a postmortem refugee crisis!. So, after sleeping on it, the good angel hired the succubi to make this circle a bit more appealing to its inhabitants. After all, everyone in Heck has an unreasonably strong libido and there ain\u0026rsquo;t no sex in Heaven, so nobody who was sent here has ever left (a couple of them tried before they heard about the renovations, but the good archangel flagged them down on the road to Heaven and said something along the lines of \u0026ldquo;please come back, there are boobs now.

I know Jimmy was a terrible person and I killed him, but Al, you\u0026rsquo;re just a normal guy who writes stupid jokes, occasionally looks at women with lust in his heart, and thinks Heroes 4 is a decent game.

Even I couldn\u0026rsquo;t sink that low,\u0026rdquo; I respond. \u0026ldquo;It all started when I stopped sending Hayden superchats and supporting him on OnlyFans. He didn\u0026rsquo;t take to that very nicely and threw me into a meat grinder, but that didn\u0026rsquo;t actually kill me. I only died because, when Philip got into a car crash, a beer bottle flew out of his hand and through his open window, eventually making contact with my head and killing me instantly.

If it takes him an average of thirteen hours to memorize a Spanish word (Jack has been near 5G towers recently and they have adversely impacted his brain), and he needs a thousand words to be conversational, how long will it take him to get there assuming he sleeps for 12 hours a night?\n\u0026lt;== Back to Math Problems Home Page \u0026lt;==\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/humor/math/9/","title":"Problema de Matemáticas Nueve: Jack Aprende Español...Despacito"},{"content":"Math Problem Eight: Ah, for Just One Time, I Would Take the Secret Passage, to Find the Hand of Chaser Reaching Down to Mexico Jack asks Chase if he can help him escape the Men in Black.

Thus, he let Jack escape his bloody scythe. The prison faculty still thought that he was dead, though, so they took him to the morgue. Jack wakes up on the autopsy table five hours later and sees a lab aid with his back turned, apparently preparing to cut him open. Jacks takes great offense at this, so he sneaks up on this sorry fellow and knocks him unconscious, robbing him of his car keys and fancy lab coat in the process. Pretending to be the lab aid, Jack sneaks into the parking garage and gets in his victim\u0026rsquo;s car.\nWhen the government hears about Jack, they believe he is a paranormal phenomenon, so they send the men in black after him. It took 5 hours before the report reached the director of the men in black, and it takes a further 5 hours to prepare their black helicopter, which is 522 miles behind Jack and can move at a 122 an hour. Jack exited the crime lab 231 miles from his buddy Chase\u0026rsquo;s house, and Jack decides to seek refuge with him. Jack stole a bad car and thus can only drive at a maximum of 75 miles an hour.

He feels in his bones that Jimmy Wales is on his side. He knows, through a burning in his bosom, that Jimmy Wales will help him get revenge on his ex-wife. He\u0026rsquo;s just got to get this Tyrone character to donate money to Wikipedia. Jack eventually finds Tyrone and implores him to give Jimbo money, reminding him of all the lazy college students \u0026amp; malnourished Somali kids who rely on it for information. But, Tyrone hardens his heart, refusing all of Jack\u0026rsquo;s pleas.\nJack knows he must get that money for Wikipedia, but he sees no way to attain it without resorting to violence. So, he withdraws his shank and thrusts it toward the other man. But, Jack is new to prison and not learned in the shank-arts. Tryone lithely intercepts his blow and unholesters a shank of his own, which penetrates Jack\u0026rsquo;s torso a moment later.\nOur hero collapses to the ground, feeling the life ebbing away from him. But Jimmy Wales remembers his servant and decides to intervene by editing Jack\u0026rsquo;s Wikipedia article to say that he is not dead.

He has nothing to eat but stale peanut butter sandwiches and no one to talk but the guard outside his cell, who keeps going on about how people in some place Jack\u0026rsquo;s never heard of have curved swords. Jack can’t feel anything but a searing hatred for his ex-wife. It’s all because of her that he\u0026rsquo;s in here. She was the one who used reverse psychology to get him to use heroin and steal his mother’s wedding ring. She was the one who stole everything from he had in his divorce. She was the one who set him on the path to coming here. Jack wants nothing but to find a way to get back at her.\nJack sits down in the cafeteria to eat. He hopes someone will offer to trade him drugs, but no luck so far. A big guy walk over to Jack and hands him a parcel. To Jack\u0026rsquo;s dismay, the parcel only contains a note, a shank and a phone. The note reads:\nTo whom it may concern,\nWe are the Cult of Wikipedia and its holy founder, Jimmy Wales. The scoffers may say that Jimmy Wales is a mortal man or that Wikipedia is not accurate, but you know these are lies. Soon, I promise, you will witness the power and glory of Jimmy Wales, but first you must prove your loyalty to him. Jimmy Wales is a jealous god and he will not accept a servant who is not willing to serve him with his all.\nYour task is simple. There’s a man named Tyrone Stevens here in ADX Florence. Before he was arrested, Tyrone promised to donate $20 to Wikipedia every month. Wikipedia’s budget could be covered if every reader donated ₵0.007 every year. How much more did he donate then he had to? He promised to show that much devotion to Jimmy Wales, and thought he didn’t have to because he’s in federal prison.\nJimmy Wales disagrees. Find a way to make him pay this money, even if you have to pry his credit card from his cold, dead hands. The shank is to help you with your work, and the phone has Jimmy\u0026rsquo;s number on it. You can ask for help if you need it.\nMay Jimmy Wales watch over you.\n-A friend.\n\u0026lt;== Back to Math Problems Home Page \u0026lt;==\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/humor/math/4/","title":"Math Problem Four: Enter Jimbo"},{"content":"Math Problem Three: In the Criminal Justice System, Copyright Violations are Considered Especially Heinous As it happens, one of the games Jack pirated contained a single sprite ripped from a Nintendo game.
