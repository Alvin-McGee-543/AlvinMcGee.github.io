<p>One day, Jack walks into his bedroom to find the IRS man standing there, waiting to pounce. He says that Jack&rsquo;s ex-wife owed Bill Clinton 32 trillion dollars in taxes, and that since Jack is marked as her next of kin, he has to pay up. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re the god emperor of mankind and all that jazz now,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but these are outstanding debts from before that, so you still have to pay up.&rdquo; Jack asks how he came to owe this money, and the tax man heaves a heavy sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, after you went to prison, you ex became romantically involved with Bill Clinton. But, their relationship ended on less than favorable terms, and after all that Bill&rsquo;s been through over the past few decades, that was the last straw. He had a psychotic break and assigned large amounts of tax debt to people for arbitrary reasons. In your ex-wife&rsquo;s case, he assigned it based on the area of a certain isosceles triangle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the base of the triangle was 8 trillion units across, but we don&rsquo;t know what its height was. All we know is that its area totalled to 32 trillion units, ergo the 32 trillion dollars you now owe to the IRS.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack thought for a second. &ldquo;This sounds phony, like those YouTube ads I get saying that if I click on them beautiful Asian women will have sex with me. If you can tell me what the height of that triangle was, I&rsquo;ll think about paying up, but otherwise you&rsquo;re gonna be in a world of hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tax man sighed. &ldquo;I was afraid of this. Now I&rsquo;ll have to do math!&rdquo;</p>
