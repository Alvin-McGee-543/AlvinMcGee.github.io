<p>Though the antichrist was able to render Jack unconscious and cast him into a coma, Pastor Jim and his armada of Florida men were able to prevail over the beast in the end. Having been defeated, Chase returned to Heck. But this time, as he had been the antichrist, he was numbered among the worst and gravest of sinners; leading to his imprisonment in the deepest and darkest pit of Heck. But, as our heroes learned earlier, it is the most sublime, pleasant, and sexually stimulating of them all. So, all things considered, this was a win for him.</p>
<p>Our heroes (except for Jack, who was still in a coma) found themselves in a world in which, though not completely marred by the archons, had still been afflicted by them. So, Philip lead the push to renew the world.</p>
<p>Just as through one man, the antichrist, all were to be made cringe, so through one man, Philip, all were made based. Just as through one man the many would be made soyjacks, so through one man the many were made chads. But each in its own order: Philip, the firstfruits, and then those like Philip on his arrival. Then came the end, when he destroyed every archon and authority and power. (The last enemy to be destroyed was the IRS) Then, when Philip had put all things in subjection under his feet, he subjected himself to Jack, so that Jack might be all in all.</p>
<p>In Kingdom of Jack, all influence of the archons has been expunged. As Pastor Jim foretold long ages ago, fast food restaurants other than Chick-fil-a have been abolished - never again will anyone get fries and a drink without being wished a blessed day. Mandatory vaccinations have been replaced with injections of various veterinary medicines, and breatharianism is now accepted nutritional orthodoxy. The gays have been returned to the closet, and the only legal use of the word &ldquo;gay&rdquo; is as a schoolyard insult. Everyone has admitted what they all knew from looking at the trees all along: that there is no God but God and Pastor Jim is his messenger. At Pastor Jim&rsquo;s bidding, Creationism has been returned to public schools. Indeed, all teaching of mainstream science has been outlawed, and science curricula are now solely based on Kent Hovind lectures. Nevermore will anyone see violence in movies nor sex on TV. Yea verily, sex has been abolished. The moon landing has been revealed as the farce it always was, and everyone knows about Agartha. The truth about 9/11 (whatever it is) has finally come out. The birth control, estrogen, micro-plastics, and fluoride that the archons put in the drinking water has been replaced with Nugenix Total-T testosterone booster, which has made all fricking frogs straight.</p>
