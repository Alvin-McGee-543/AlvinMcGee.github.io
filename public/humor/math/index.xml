      <description>Epilogue: The Eschatological Victory of Jack Though the antichrist was able to render Jack unconscious and cast him into a coma, Pastor Jim and his armada of Florida men were able to prevail over the beast in the end. Having been defeated, Chase returned to Heck. But this time, as he had been the antichrist, he was numbered among the worst and gravest of sinners; leading to his imprisonment in the deepest and darkest pit of Heck.</description>

      <description>Math Problem Forty: It&amp;rsquo;s the End of the Line of the Final Journey Jack and his friends run into Jeffery Epstein&amp;rsquo;s house, frantically searching for George Soros and Klaus Schwab - the last two of the archons.

They rush up the stairs like there&amp;rsquo;s no tomorrow.</description>

&amp;ldquo;I was once slain, but now I live. I am Jack, conqueror of death!</description>

As they go forward, Jack ceases to be the disembodied ghost he has been, and finds himself arrayed as the god - emperor of mankind once more.</description>

      <description>Math Problem Thirty-Seven: The Deepest Pit of Heck Jack and his compatriots steel themselves for what&amp;rsquo;s ahead, for they know the next circle of Heck is deepest and darkest one, home to the greatest of sinners. It is the place where the soul Jack must rescue for his quest is said to dwell.
But, when they get there, they&amp;rsquo;re pleasantly surprised. It just looks like a bar. Some lit EDM beats are playing in the background, and the stench of beer can be detected everywhere.</description>

‚ÄúWhat happened to Satan, man? I was looking forward to whipping his ass!‚Äù says Philip.

      <description>Math Problem Thirty-Six: Two True Scotsmen The next circle of Heck looks rather peaceful. When Jack first enters it, nothing seems out of the ordinary. All sees is a pot roasting over a campfire, around which sit Shrek and John Duns Scotus.
&amp;lsquo;Like zoinks!&amp;quot; exclaims Shaggy. &amp;ldquo;Shrek, I was your biggest fan! John Duns Scotus, you were incredibly influential on my understanding of the univocity of theological verbiage! What did you guys do to, like, get darned to Heck!</description>

Their punishment is to forever be imprisoned within an enlarged version of the average public high school bathroom.</description>

He turns around and scampers away, his four chins swaying like hay in the wind. But, as his blubbery hand flops onto the door knob, Jack has a change of heart. His body accelerates from a standstill to 1,373 meters per second toward the taxman. If Jack weighs 62 kilograms, how many newtons of force will he exert upon the tax man&amp;rsquo;s body when they make contact, assuming that the air exercises 15 newtons of drag on him?</description>

Impulsively, almost instinctively, Jack moves toward him and asks for drugs.
&amp;ldquo;¬°No hablo ingles!&amp;rdquo; responds the other man, qui√©n es totalmente hispanoablante.</description>

      <description>Math Problem Six: Jack Hits the Road The Grim Reaper checked Jack&amp;rsquo;s Wikipedia page just after Jimmy Wales edited it. Thus, he let Jack escape his bloody scythe. The prison faculty still thought that he was dead, though, so they took him to the morgue. Jack wakes up on the autopsy table five hours later and sees a lab aid with his back turned, apparently preparing to cut him open. Jacks takes great offense at this, so he sneaks up on this sorry fellow and knocks him unconscious, robbing him of his car keys and fancy lab coat in the process.</description>

He has nothing to eat but stale peanut butter sandwiches and no one to talk but the guard outside his cell, who keeps going on about how people in some place Jack&amp;rsquo;s never heard of have curved swords. Jack can‚Äôt feel anything but a searing hatred for his ex-wife. It‚Äôs all because of her that he&amp;rsquo;s in here. She was the one who used reverse psychology to get him to use heroin and steal his mother‚Äôs wedding ring.</description>

They quickly capture Jack and have him hauled before a grand jury to stand trial for his crimes against God, nature, and humanity.</description>
