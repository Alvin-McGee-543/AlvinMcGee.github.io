      <description>Assorted Awful Advice - A series of articles I write explaining how to fill one&amp;rsquo;s life with suffering, failure, and frustration. Usually updated every month or so.
Half Empty or Half Full? - Whether the glass is half empty or half full is and has always been a matter of much debate. To answer this question once in for all, we gathered the worldâ€™s philosophers to find out what they think.</description>

      <description>Assorted Awful Advice This page is written by Wilhelm Spurtendorf, lover of all things painful and frustrating.
Most of the time people seek out advice, it&amp;rsquo;s because they want to get better at something. Pages upon pages of this sort of stuff can be found all over the internet. It&amp;rsquo;s almost a damn deluge! Of course, this is all well and good for some people, but it&amp;rsquo;s horrible for people like me: mascochists!</description>

      <description>Introduction While my Christian Homeschool co - op had many idiosyncrasies, one of the most memorable is how we were forced to read and complete math problems before our classmates. Sometimes these were taken out of textbooks or off of the internet, but more often we invented them ourselves (frequently on the drive over to school or during lunch). Mostly, their narratives were really boring, like the point was supposed to be learning math or something.</description>

      <description>Half Empty or Half Full? (Note: all of this is very silly and none of it ought to be taken seriously)
Whether the glass is half empty or half full is and has always been a matter of much debate. In a question to answer this age - old question, we first asked the world&amp;rsquo;s philosohpers, then mebers of major religious groups, and (at last, for good measure, we asked several major political figures).</description>

      <description>In our quest to find out whether the glass was half empty or half full, we first asked the world&amp;rsquo;s great philosophers. Here are their responses.
Leibniz says: This is the fullest of all possible glasses.
Schopenhauer says: Everything sucks, including the glass (but especially women).
Thales says: The glass is completely full because the air in the top half is also water.
The mereological nihilist says: There is no glass.</description>

      <title>Half Empty or Half Full? Politicans respond.</title>

      <description>For good measure, we also reached out to several prominent politicians for their thoughts on the matter.
Kamala Harris says: It is in the Venn diagram of glasses which are half empty and glasses which are half full.
Donald Trump says: Half of this glass was stolen by brutal MS - 13 gang members, allowed to invade across our Southern border by the radical left. It&amp;rsquo;s just horrible, horrible what they&amp;rsquo;re doing to our country.</description>

      <description>We also asked some religious people &amp;ndash; God&amp;rsquo;s gotta have something to say about the great questions of life, right?
The agnostic says: I don&amp;rsquo;t know.
The strong agnostic says: You don&amp;rsquo;t know.
The gnostic says: I know, and it makes me feel important, so you don&amp;rsquo;t get to know.
The atheist says: &amp;hellip; [excuse us, we appear to have contacted a brick by mistake &amp;ndash; it lacks a belief in God]</description>
