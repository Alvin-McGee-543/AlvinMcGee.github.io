<p><em>Sleazy McFly is a well - known self help author and convicted con artist. About 70 people have bought his free book, and more than four of them didn&rsquo;t try to sue him afterwards.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Hey there fellas, I&rsquo;m Sleazy McFly, but you can call me Sleaze for short. I&rsquo;m here to make you rich, and if you follow all of my advice down to the letter, I can confidently tell you that one of us will be richer than he was before!</p>
<p><strong>1.) Invest in my cryptocurrency.</strong> My cryptocurrency, SleazeCoin, is a up and coming player on the cryptocurrency scene, and is already accepted as legal tender in the great nation of Whambezia.</p>
<p><strong>2.) Start gambling.</strong> See the previous point. You gotta be dedicated about it, though, can&rsquo;t be a sunshine gambler. Even if things get bad, you&rsquo;ve got to keep pulling that lever. 99% of gamblers quit right before their next big win.</p>
<p><strong>3.) Give 75% of your income to me.</strong> Now, you may be thinking, &ldquo;Sleaze, why the hell would I do that? That&rsquo;s just what a con artist would tell me to do!&rdquo; Well, you only think that because you&rsquo;re an idiot! I ain&rsquo;t no conman, good old Sleaze would never con a fly. Who are you gonna believe, me or your lying eyes? Either way, science backs this piece of advice up: 98% (!) of non - millionaires have not given 75% of their income to me[1]. Therefore, paying up is one of the most sure - fire ways you can become one.</p>
<p><strong>4.) Buy expensive things in public.</strong> If you publicly spend a load of money, it may not make you a millionaire, but it&rsquo;ll at least make other people think you have disposable income.</p>
<p><strong>5.) Commit tax fraud.</strong> This both lets you keep more money and sets you apart from the blue - pilled sheeple.</p>
<p><strong>6.) Take money out of offering plates at churches.</strong> Churches are collecting that money to give to well - off, wannabe millionaires (that&rsquo;s what Jesus was all about, right?). It&rsquo;s no harm to take some out directly.</p>
<p><strong>7.) Sell your soul to the Devil.</strong> Selling your immortal soul to the prince of darkness may sound like a bad idea. But, he&rsquo;s offering a substantial sum of money in exchange for it. And, in the immortal words of Tommy Johnson, a musician who enjoyed great success after forfeiting his soul at a roadside deal with the Devil, &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t like I was using it or nothing.&rdquo; [2]</p>
<p><strong>8.) Buy my free book.</strong> My free book is a magical talisman which will turn dirt into gold. I&rsquo;ll send it to you if you email me your name, your social security number, and your mother&rsquo;s maiden name.</p>
