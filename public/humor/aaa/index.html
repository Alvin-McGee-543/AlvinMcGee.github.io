<p><em>This page is written by Wilhelm Spurtendorf, lover of all things painful and frustrating.</em></p>
<p>Most of the time people seek out advice, it&rsquo;s because they want to get better at something. Pages upon pages of this sort of stuff can be found all over the internet. It&rsquo;s almost a damn deluge! Of course, this is all well and good for some people, but it&rsquo;s horrible for people like me: mascochists!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean watered down, trendy masochism - the kind where you just want to pretend your girlfriend is an Arab slave trader and have her pretend you&rsquo;re a <em>piñata.</em> No, I mean hardcore, traditional masochism, the kind where you make your mission in life experiencing as much gratuitous suffering as possible. Being a member of this demographic, I&rsquo;ve always noticed how we&rsquo;re excluded from this hedonormative society, and especially from places where hedonormative people give advice. They just assume everyone doesn&rsquo;t want to experience suffering and failure!</p>
<p>To mend this gaping hole in the online landscape, I&rsquo;ve begun curating a series of articles with the goal of helping you live the most unpleasant, painful, and downright miserable life you possibly can, all with the help of some of the world&rsquo;s greatest givers of terrible advice.</p>
