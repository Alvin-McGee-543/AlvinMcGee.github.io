## Math Problem Thirty-One: The Hivemind

[💀 Ruin your romantic relationships to the rhythm of Reddit's Theme Song while reading and working out this math problem for a fuller experience 💀](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpQQrdglDmw)

Before the gate to the next circle of heck, there stands a morbidly obese titan, one large enough to blow the square cube law to smithereens. Upon his head is a fedora, upon his face, a neckbeard. And, upon his chest is a dirty "I FUCKING LOVE SCIENCE!" t-shirt. His body exudes a stench potent enough to strike down the nations, and his face is so hideous as to make medusa look like a New York Nine.

“Like ZOINKS dude!” Exclaims Shaggy. “Who, like, are you dude?”

The giant turns toward him with malice in its eyes. “We are the Reddit. We are **LEGION**.” 

“Oh. How, like, are you doing?”

It cackles – a painful, bone chilling sound which makes Jack cover his ears in pain. “**In this moment, we are euphoric! Not because of any phoney God’s blessing, but because we are enlightened by our own intelligence!**" At this, he breaks out into more hideous laughter, as though to demonstrate to the world just how euphoric he is.

“Within us are the souls of all people who have ever made a Reddit account. Joining Reddit is so heinous that the moment a person does it, his soul is sucked down into Heck to be absorbed into us! His body is left behind to be possessed by demons -- nasty, ugly things." He breaks out into loathsome cackling, punctuated by a horrible noise in his throat, like a cat coughing up hairballs. 

"Granted, this isn't as impressive as it sounds because 74% of all Reddit accounts are bots, and every Redditor has 17 acconts, -- 16 to upvote his comments & one for porn. If there are 430 million accounts, how many are owned by real people? How many people used Reddit before joining us? What percentage of Reddit accounts are bots? What percentage are for porn?

Immediately after the giant finishes speaking, Philip jumps into action and pulverises him. We, however, are still left to ponder his questions.
