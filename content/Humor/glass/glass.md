# Half Empty or Half Full?

*(Note: all of this is very silly and none of it ought to be taken seriously)*

Whether the glass is half empty or half full is and has always been a matter of much debate. In a question to answer this age - old question, we first asked the world's philosohpers, then mebers of major religious groups, and (at last, for good measure, we asked several major political figures). This is what they said:

[Part I: Philosophers](/humor/glass/phil)

[Part II: Religions](/humor/glass/religion)

[Part III: Politicans](/humor/glass/politics)
