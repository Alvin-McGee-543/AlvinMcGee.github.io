For good measure, we also reached out to several prominent politicians for their thoughts on the matter.

* Kamala Harris says: It is in the Venn diagram of glasses which are half empty and glasses which are half full.

* Donald Trump says: Half of this glass was stolen by brutal MS - 13 gang members, allowed to invade across our Southern border by the radical left. It's just horrible, horrible what they're doing to our country.

* Joe Biden says: what you saying, Jack? ... "shabapaqoba?" ... Come on, man.

* Marjorie Taylor Green says: DA JOOOS!!! DA JOOOS STOLE HALF OF THE GLASS!!! WITH THEIR WEATHER MACHINES!!! IT IS WRITTEN ON THE GUIDESTONES!!!

* Beto O'Rourke says: [something obscene about cows. We daren't repeat it here]

* Kristie Noem says: I shot the glass.
